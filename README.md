# SubsetSum-BacktrackAlgorithm
Solving the popular NP problem, The Subset Sum Problem, with a Amortized O(n) algorithm based on Backtracking. Literally takes 0.01sec to find sums 10000+ terms long!

Problem Statement : Find a set of N numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 that sum up to a random number X (1,000,000 < X < NÃ—1,000,000).

The Algorithm stood second fastest in the organized Intra-University competition, and needs no extra storage space/buffers. Lost only to a Randomized Dynamic programming algorithm, which has a small chance of giving an invalid answer.

The graph of time taken vs number of terms N was linear, as below:
