# SubsetSum-BacktrackAlgorithm
Solving the popular NP problem, The Subset Sum Problem, with a Amortized O(n) algorithm based on Backtracking. Literally takes 0.01sec to find sums 10000+terms long!

The Algorithm stood second fastest in the organized Intra-University competition, and needs no extra storage space/buffers. Lost only to a Randomized Dynamic programming algorithm, which has a small chance of giving an invalid answer.
